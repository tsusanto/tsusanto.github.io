I hosted another pot luck party today for 6 lovely ladies and I made this. Stress free recipe that tastes good at room temperature too.

Ingredients:
- 12 cloves of garlic, finely minced
- 1 lb of any kind of pasta
- 1 bunch of parsley, finely chopped
- As little or as much bacon as you like, diced
- Chili flakes
- Parmesan cheese, freshly grated

Steps:
1. Boil pasta in salted water
2. Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil, add bacon, minced garlic and chopped parsley. Stir fry for 5 minutes or so
2. Add some chili flakes if you like it a bit spicy, salt and ground pepper
3. Add 1/2 cup of the pasta water (from step 1) to make a thin sauce, stir for 1 minute
4. Add cooked pasta, mix it well
5. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley and top it with a generous amount of parmesan cheese
