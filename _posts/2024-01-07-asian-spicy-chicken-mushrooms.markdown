Ingredients:
- 1 lb of boneless chicken thigh, cut into bite sized pieces
- 8 dried whole chili (I bought a big bag from an asian grocery store)
- 4 cloves of garlic
- Shitake mushrooms, sliced
- chicken bouillon (I like using the brand Better Than Bouillon)
- 2 tablespoon of oyster sauce
- 2 tablespoon of soy sauce
- 2 tablespoon of indonesian sweet soy sauce [(kecap manis)][1]{:target="_blank"}
- 2 tablespoon of cornstarch
- cilantro, green onions for garnishing
- salt and lots of black pepper

Steps:
1. Heat up some oil, add chicken pieces and dried chili, pan fry for about 2 minutes
2. Add soy sauce and indonesian sweet soy sauce. Stir to coat the sauces onto the chicken pieces
3. Let it pan fry for about 10 minutes until it looks nicely browned, occasionally stir it around, so it doesn't burn
4. Add garlic and mushrooms, stir for a minute
5. Add oyster sauce, lots of freshly ground black pepper and salt to taste
6. Stir-fry for another 2 minutes, add 2 cups of water and 1 tablespoon of chicken bouillon and let it simmer on low heat for about 8 minutes with the lid closed
7. Dissolve cornstarch in some water, add to the pot to thicken the sauce
8. Garnish with chopped cilantro and green onions. Serve with steamed rice
