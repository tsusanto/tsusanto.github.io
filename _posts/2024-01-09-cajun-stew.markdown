Ingredients:
- 1/2 cup flour
- 1/4 cup butter
- 1/4 cup margarine
- 1 can diced tomatoes
- 1 onion, diced
- 1 smoked sausage, diced
- cayenne pepper
- shredded cooked chicken (I used leftover Costco rotisserie chicken)
- 1 cup of frozen corn
- 2 tablespoon of chicken bouillon
- 2 cans kidney beans
- 2 tablespoon Slap yo mama cajun seasoning
- 1 liter of water
- tomato paste
- cayenne pepper, bay leaves, dried thyme
- parsley for garnish

Steps:
1. Make the roux by melting the butter and margarine in a pot, slowly add the flour. Lower heat and stir it occasionally for 15 minutes. In the last few minutes, you can turn up the heat so the roux turns golden brown. It does take some patience here
2. Add onions and diced sausage. Cook for about 3 minutes
3. Add water, chicken bouillon, cayenne pepper, diced tomatoes, frozen corn, shredded chicken, kidney beans, cajun seasoning, tomato paste, bay leaves and thyme. No need to add salt as slap yo mama seasoning is salty.
4. Simmer on low heat for 30 minutes
5. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley. Serve it with rice
