Another fun session of pickleball today. My pickleball partner and I won all 4 games today against hard hitting guys. It's a good day indeed.

I made this salad for dinner, very easy and refreshing salad. Tastes better if you make it an hour before serving it.

Ingredients:
- 2 oranges (I like using Cara cara oranges)
- 1 big fennel bulb
- 2 tablespoons of [white balsamic vinegar][1]{:target="_blank"} 
- 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil
- baby arugula
- salt and pepper to taste

Steps:
1. Finely slice the fennel
2. Segment the orange (do it over the bowl of fennel so it catches the orange juice)
2. Add white balsamic vinegar, olive oil, salt and pepper
3. Stir it well. Throw in some baby arugula leaves on top but don't stir it in, or it will wilt
4. I happen to have a pomegranate on hand, so I sprinkled some seeds as it looks so pretty
