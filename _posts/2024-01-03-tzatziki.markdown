Ingredients:
- 4 persian cucumbers
- 1 tbsp dried dill
- 1.5 cup of plain yogurt
- 1 small clove of garlic (not the whole bulb!)
- Lemon juice to taste if you like it more tangy
- Salt to taste

Steps:
1. Peel the cucumbers(optional). Grate cucumbers. Squeeze out the water from the grated cucumbers, transfer to a bowl
2. Add finely minced garlic (I like to use a garlic press)
3. Add dill, yogurt and a sprinkle of salt, lemon if using, mix well. Let it sit in the fridge for at least an hour before serving 
4. Drizzle with some olive oil just before serving
