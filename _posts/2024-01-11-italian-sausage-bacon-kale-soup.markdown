I hosted a fun ladies pot luck today, lovely conversations and I had a fabulous time! 
I made this soup the morning of, leaving me plenty of time to set up the party.

Ingredients:
- 1/2 lb of italian sausage
- 4 slices of bacon, diced
- 4 yukon gold potatoes, peeled and quartered
- 2 cloves of garlic, chopped
- chopped kale
- 1/2 cup of sour cream
- chili flakes
- tomato paste
- smoked paprika
- 1 tablespoon of chicken bouillon (I like the brand "Better than Bouillon")
- lemon juice from 1/2 lemon

Steps:
1. Heat some oil in a dutch oven, add italian sausage, stir fry for 3 minutes or so
2. Add garlic, diced bacon to the pot, stir fry for another 2 minutes
3. Add water, chicken bouillon, let it come to a boil
4. Add chopped kale, tomato paste, smoked paprika, potatoes
5. Lower heat, simmer for 30 minutes, turn off stove. I like to let it sit for at least an hour for the flavors to develop.
6. When ready to serve, mix sour cream with some of the broth in a small bowl, stir until sour cream is dissolved. Pour sour cream mixture into the pot. Add lemon juice
7. Boil for another 5 minutes and serve
