I love decluttering, and even better if I can get some money for the things I don't need anymore. Today I sold my old pickleball paddle for $40 and an original Apple macbook charger for $20 through Craigslist. I always feel lighter when I get rid of stuff. 

This is an easy and quick stir fry, and I like to eat this with steamed Thai jasmine rice, it's my go to comfort food.

Ingredients:
- 1 lb of pork, any cut, thinly sliced
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 4 [korean green chili peppers][1]{:target="_blank"}  (it's not spicy at all, I bought it from a korean grocery store)
- 1 bunch of thai holy basil (torn into small pieces)
- 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
- 2 tablespoon soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons of indonesian sweet soy sauce [(kecap manis)][2]{:target="_blank"}
- 1 tablespoon of sugar
- 2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
- 1 onion, sliced
- salt and pepper to taste

Steps:
1. Heat up 3 tablespoon of oil, add pork slices
2. Add sugar and indonesian sweet soy sauce to the pan, let it pan fry for 10 minutes, occasionally stir it around so it doesn't get burnt. Eventually it will get nicely browned
3. Add soy sauce, oyster sauce, garlic, stir fry for another 3 minutes
2. Add bell peppers, korean peppers, onions and stir fry for another 2 minutes
3. Add basil leaves, quickly stir for 10 seconds. Serve immediately with white jasmine rice
