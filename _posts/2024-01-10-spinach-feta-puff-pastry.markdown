We often host dinners for friends, and this is one of my favorite appetizers to make. Always a hit and I never have any leftovers.

Ingredients:
- 3 (5 inch x 5 inch) squares of puff pastry
- 1/2 cup of frozen cut spinach, thawed
- 1/2 cup of feta cheese
- 2 tablespoon of dried dill 
- chili flakes
- 1 egg white, slightly beaten


Steps:
1. Cut the puff pastry squares into 4 smaller squares each, yielding 12 little squares
2. Grease a 12 slot nonstick mini muffin pan. Lightly press each puff pastry square into each cup
3. Mix the spinach, feta cheese, dried dill, chili flakes together, Add salt and pepper, mix it well.
4. Divide the filling evenly into each puff pastry square. Pinch the puff pastry to close it up
5. Brush each pastry with the egg wash
6. Bake at 360F for 14 minutes, might take less or more time depending on your oven, so watch it carefully
